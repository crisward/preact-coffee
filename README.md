# Preact Coffee

A quick starter template for Preact using CJSX, coffee-script with JSX.
This project is setup to use preact compat, so all the files look like we're using react.

## Why?

I like coffeescript, React, and small build files.

```
git clone https://github.com/crisward/preact-coffee.git

```

## Npm Scripts

```bash
npm run watch # watch coffee & cjsx files and rebuild on change
npm run build # build and minify js file
```

## Recent Updates
Uses latest version of Preact, so hooks, fragment etc are available.
